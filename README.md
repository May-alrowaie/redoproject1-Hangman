Welcome to the Hangman Game! This is a simple web-based implementation of the classic word-guessing game where players try to guess 
a hidden word by suggesting letters within a certain number of attempts.

## Game Overview

In this Hangman game, players have to guess a randomly selected word by entering letters. 
With each incorrect guess, the player loses one of their limited attempts.
The game ends when the player either guesses the word correctly or runs out of attempts.

## How to Play

Start the game by clicking the "Start Game" button.
Enter a letter in the input field and click the "Guess" button.
Each correct letter will reveal its position(s) in the word.
For each incorrect guess, your remaining attempts will decrease.
The game ends when you either guess the word correctly or run out of attempts.
